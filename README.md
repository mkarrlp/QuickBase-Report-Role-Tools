# QuickBaseReportRoleViewResizer

Requires TamperMonkey to work!

Resizes the box containing roles when editing a report so it is easier to find roles in the list. After QuickBases update in March 2019 or so they made the box very tiny, it only shows you 4-5 roles at a time. If you have a lot of roles in your application this is very difficult to use.
